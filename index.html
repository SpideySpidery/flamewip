    <ol>
    <li><p><strong>Human Durability</strong>:<br>Zackâ€™s durability is limited by his human nature.  </p>
    <ul>
    <li>He can strengthen his <strong>fists</strong> using energy to block attacks, stop swords, or absorb explosions.  </li>
    <li>This ability works only when his fists are glowing, as it consumes energy to invigorate his body.</li>

    <li><p><strong>Anger Issues</strong>:  </p>
    <ul>
    <li>Zack gets angry easily, which makes him explosive and prone to losing control.  </li>
    <li>In this state, he becomes vulnerable to severe attacks due to carelessness but also gains a temporary edge by using 100% of his strength without restraint.</li>
